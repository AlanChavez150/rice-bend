GitHub restricts the size of all files to be under 1GB which is too small for some of the experimental data.
To get around this experimental data is stored on google drive in a zip file.

Download that file and unzip it here.

The heatmap.m file in this folder is a matlab script that was used to connect to an O-scope and capture time domain captures.
It's included here as a reference as to how the data was caputred and the format of the .mat files that contain the data.
